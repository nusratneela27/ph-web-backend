# Recipe Data Backend Server

This project serves as a backend server designed to connect to a MongoDB database to fetch and manage data related to Recipe data. It provides an efficient way to handle and retrieve cooking-related data through a robust server built with Node.js.

## Getting Started

To get the development server running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   nodemon index.js
   ```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your react.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform].

### Deployment Steps

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:

   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy the application**:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. **Deploy the application to production**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure MongoDB is properly set up and running before starting the server.
- Configure your environment variables for MongoDB connection in a `.env` file.
